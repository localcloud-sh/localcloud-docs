# lc reset

Reset your LocalCloud project to a clean state. Choose from different reset levels based on how much you want to preserve or remove.

## Usage

```bash
lc reset [flags]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--keep-data` | Keep data volumes and databases | `true` |
| `--hard` | Remove everything including data and config | `false` |
| `--destroy` | Complete project destruction (removes everything) | `false` |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip confirmation prompts | `false` |
| `--keep-models` | Keep AI models during reset | `true` |

<Warning>
    Reset operations are **IRREVERSIBLE**. Always backup important data before running reset commands.
</Warning>

## Reset Levels

### 1. Soft Reset (Default)

The safest reset option that preserves your data.

```bash
lc reset
```

**What gets removed:**
-  Stop all running services
-  Remove service containers
-  Clear container logs

**What gets preserved:**
-  Data volumes (databases, storage)
-  Configuration files
-  AI models
-  Project structure

**Use when:**
- Services are misbehaving
- Need to restart cleanly
- Containers are corrupted
- Want to change service versions

### 2. Hard Reset

More aggressive cleanup that removes data and configuration.

```bash
lc reset --hard
```

**What gets removed:**
-  Everything from soft reset
-  Data volumes and databases
-  Configuration files
-  AI models (unless `--keep-models`)
-  Log files and temporary data

**What gets preserved:**
-  Project directory structure
-  Docker networks (shared)

**Use when:**
- Complete fresh start needed
- Configuration is corrupted
- Want to reclaim disk space
- Starting new project type

### 3. Destroy (Complete Removal)

**  MOST DESTRUCTIVE** - Complete project destruction.

```bash
lc reset --destroy
```

**What gets removed:**
-  Everything from hard reset
-  Docker networks
-  Project metadata
-  All LocalCloud traces

**Confirmation required:**
- Must type `DESTROY` to confirm
- Cannot be undone

**Use when:**
- Completely removing LocalCloud
- Major system cleanup
- Corrupted installation
- Starting from scratch

```

## Skip Confirmation

For automated scripts or when you're certain:

```bash
# Soft reset without confirmation
lc reset --yes

# Hard reset without confirmation  
lc reset --hard --yes

# Destroy without typing confirmation (still requires --yes)
lc reset --destroy --yes
```

## Reset Scenarios

### Fix Corrupted Services

```bash
# Services won't start or behave strangely
lc reset
lc start

# Check if services are healthy
lc status
```

### Reclaim Disk Space

```bash
# Remove data but keep models
lc reset --hard --keep-models

# Remove everything
lc reset --hard

# Check freed space
lc info
```

### Change Project Configuration

```bash
# Reset to reconfigure
lc reset --hard

# Setup new configuration
lc setup

# Start with new config
lc start
```

### Complete Fresh Start

```bash
# Remove everything
lc reset --destroy

# Initialize new project
lc init

# Setup fresh configuration
lc setup
```

## Pre-Reset Checklist

### Before Any Reset

1. **Backup Important Data**
   ```bash
   # Export database
   lc exec postgres pg_dump localcloud > backup.sql
   
   # Backup storage files
   lc exec minio mc mirror /data/minio ~/minio-backup
   ```

2. **Note Current Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Save current config
   cp .localcloud/config.yaml config-backup.yaml
   
   # List current models
   lc models list > models-backup.txt
   ```

3. **Check Disk Usage**
   ```bash
   # See what will be removed
   lc info
   docker system df
   ```

### Before Hard Reset

1. **Export Critical Data**
   ```bash
   # Database dump
   lc exec postgres pg_dump -U localcloud localcloud > db-backup.sql
   
   # MongoDB dump  
   lc exec mongodb mongodump --out /backup
   ```

2. **Save Model List**
   ```bash
   # Note which models to re-download
   lc models list --format=names > models-to-reinstall.txt
   ```

### Before Destroy

1. **Complete Backup**
   ```bash
   # Create full project backup
   tar -czf project-backup.tar.gz .localcloud/ *.sql *.txt
   ```

2. **Document Setup**
   ```bash
   # Save setup documentation
   lc config show > project-setup.txt
   lc component list > components.txt
   ```

## Post-Reset Recovery

### After Soft Reset

```bash
# Simply restart services
lc start

# Verify everything works
lc status
lc doctor
```

### After Hard Reset

```bash
# Reconfigure project
lc setup

# Restore data if backed up
lc start
lc exec postgres psql -U localcloud -d localcloud < backup.sql

# Reinstall models
lc models pull llama3.2:3b
```

### After Destroy

```bash
# Start completely fresh
lc init my-project
cd my-project
lc setup

# Restore from backup if needed
lc start
# ... restore data and models
```

## Troubleshooting

### Reset Fails

```bash
Error: cannot remove container: container is running
```

**Solutions:**
1. Force stop services: `lc stop --force`
2. Kill containers: `docker kill $(docker ps -q)`
3. Try reset again: `lc reset`

### Docker Permission Issues

```bash
Error: permission denied
```

**Solutions:**
1. Use sudo: `sudo lc reset`
2. Fix Docker permissions: `sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock`
3. Add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

### Partial Reset Completion

```bash
Warning: some resources could not be removed
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check what remains: `lc ps -a`
2. Manual cleanup: `docker system prune -a`
3. Restart Docker service
4. Try reset again

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Prompts

- **Soft Reset**: Simple yes/no confirmation
- **Hard Reset**: Shows what will be removed + size
- **Destroy**: Requires typing "DESTROY"

### Dry Run Mode

```bash
# See what would be removed (proposed feature)
lc reset --dry-run
lc reset --hard --dry-run
```

### Backup Suggestions

Reset command automatically suggests backup commands:

```
=¡ Tip: Consider backing up your data first:
   lc exec postgres pg_dump localcloud > backup.sql
   
   To restore later:
   lc exec postgres psql -U localcloud -d localcloud < backup.sql
```
